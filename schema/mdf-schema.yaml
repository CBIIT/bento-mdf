      This is a human-readable short name for the model described in the MDF, that

      from a Metamodel Database
  Version:
    type: string
    desc: |
      This is a human-readable version string (e.g., v1.7.2) for the model described
      in the MDF. Best practice is to keep it in sync with a git tag for which a
      GitHub release has been made.
  URI:
    $ref: "#/defs/url"
    desc: |
      If present, this should be a resolving URL that can provide further detailed information
      about the model described in the MDF instance. Ideally, it should be the base URL for a
      terminology server (like the Simple Terminology Server), that can be concatenated with
      path information in the MDF to return details. Currently, an enumerated value set can
      be included "by reference" in the MDF, using a path. Joining the URL value and the
      path value with a backslash should create a url that resolves to a REST GET access of
      an STS that can return the actual list of enumerated values.

          Steps: specifies an array of objects defining the python package and the
          function entrypoint. The first entrypoint will process source property
          values as defined by Inputs, and the last entrypoint will emit destination
          property values as defined by Outputs. Intermediate entrypoints must have
          inputs that conform to the output of the previous step and outputs that
          conform to the inputs of the subsequent step. Intermediate and final steps
          can specify Params.
          If Defaults:Package is set, and no steps require parameters (besides
          Inputs:Params:), then you can simply provide a list of <modules>.<function>
          strings in order of intended execution. Outputs must still conform to inputs.

        description: |
          The value of Identities is a list of direct verbatim "liftover" mappings from
          a single source model property value to a single destination model property
          value. Each entry specifies the source and destination properties, in an
          explicit form or a short form, a two-element array containing the source and
          destination properties (in that order) using a dot notation:
          [<model>.<version>.<node>.]<prop>. If Defaults is specified, the first 3 elements
          are optional.
          Note that any identity element could be expressed as a transform in the Transforms
          section. Because identities are so common and simple, this section provides a 
          more readable and less verbose shortcut for entering many such transforms.
